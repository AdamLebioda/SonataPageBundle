Shared Blocks
=============

By default, the blocks you create to populate your pages are tied to their page.
It means the same block cannot be reused in several pages.

The ``SharedBlockAdmin`` class provides a way to deal with this limitation.
It allows you to manage free blocks that are not linked to pages or to parent blocks just as you usually do with classic page blocks.
This way, shared blocks are common to all your sites.

.. note::

    Changes on a shared block are likely to be echoed on pages which are using it as soon as a new snapshot is created for this page.
